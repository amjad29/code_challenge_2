Describe your submission here.

i used node js 

i have created a server with 3 APIs revoke, grant, get subscrubsion list 
to run my code you have to go to `lib` file 
run npm install 
then npm start to lunch the server 
the npm run-script run to run the test 


revoke, grant input is list of objects each one validating the records according to there own criteria 
i added some validation like we should define the file name in our system before getting any file from the folder to avoiding process any not related file 

i used `shared` file as the service DB 

i think the structure of the inputs have some missing data like 'id'
